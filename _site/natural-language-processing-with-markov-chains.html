<h1>Natural Language Processing With Markov Chains</h1>
<p>Natural Language Generation (NLG) is a method of creating new text based on some given raw text. Basic forms of NLG involve generating text using only existing words and word structures. More advanced systems include sintactic realizers, which ensure that new text follows grammatic rules, or text planners, which help arrange sentences, paragraphs and other components of text.</p>

<p>Automatical text generation can be used for a variety of tasks, among others:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Automatic documentation generation</li>
  <li>Automatic reports from raw data</li>
  <li>Explanations in expert systems</li>
  <li>Medical informatics</li>
  <li>Machine translation between natural languages</li>
  <li>Chatbots</li>
</ul>

<p>The basic idea of Markov chains is that future state of the system can be predicted based solely on the current state. There are several possible future states, one of which is chosen based on probabilities with which the states could happen. Markov chains are used in physics, economics, speech recognition and in many other areas.</p>

<p>If we apply Markov chains to NLG, we can generate text based on the idea that next possible word can be predicted on N previous words.</p>

<p>In this notebook I’ll start with generating text based only on one previous word, and then will try to improve the quality of predictions.</p>

<p>The text I will use for NLG will be Rush’s <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-cGM3TH--WXbHJTd2traHE1aEU/edit">entire lyrical discography</a>. Every lyric from every song wrote by the band.</p>

<h1 id="data-collection">Data Collection</h1>

<p>As I said previously, the raw data I used for NLP was Rush’s entire discography. <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-cGM3TH--WXbHJTd2traHE1aEU/edit">This pdf</a> contains every lyric the band has written. Python’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">pdfPlumber</code> library does a decent job of extracting text from .pdf files:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>import pdfplumber

    sys.stdout = f # Change the standard output to the file we created.
    with pdfplumber.open(r'Rush-Lyrics.pdf') as pdf:
        for i in range(4,189):
            curr_page = pdf.pages[i]
            print(curr_page.extract_text())
    sys.stdout = original_stdout # Reset the standard output to its original value

print('extracted lyrics to file')
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With all the lyrics in a single text file, we’re now ready for some analysis.</p>

<p>The code consists of two parts: building a dictionary of all words with their possible next words and generating text based on this dictionary.</p>

<p>Text is splitted into words. Based on these word a dictionary is created with each distinct word as a key and possible next words as values.</p>

<p>After this the new text is generated. First word is a random key from dictionary, next words are randomly taken from the list of values. The text is generated until number of words reaches the defined limit.</p>

<p>Alas, we have a severe overfitting!</p>

<h2 id="backoff">Backoff</h2>

<p>One of the ways to tackle it is back-off. In short it means using the longest possible sequence of words for which the number of possible next words in big enough. The algorithm has the following steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for a key with length <script type="math/tex">N</script> check the number of possible values</li>
  <li>if the number is higher that a defined threshold, select a random word and start algorithm again with the new key</li>
  <li>if the number is lower that the threshold, then try a taking <script type="math/tex">N-1</script> last words from the key and check the number of possible values for this sequence</li>
  <li>if the length of the sequence dropped to one, then the next word is randomly selected based on the original key</li>
</ul>

<p>Technically this means that a nested dictionary is necessary, which will contain keys with the length up to <script type="math/tex">N</script>.</p>

<p>That’s it. This is as far ar simple Markov chains can go. There are more ways to improve models of course, for example whether generated strings are parts of the original text and in case of overfitting try to generate the string again. Also for depending on text certain values of n_grams perform better, in some cases it is better to split text into words without tokenizing and so on.</p>

<p>But more technics are necessary to create a truly meaningful text, such as mentioned at the beginning of the notebook.</p>

<p>And here are some interesting phrases/sentences which were generated:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>You can forget about the people of NASA for their inspiration and cooperation.</li>
    <li>The universe has failed me - not a dog’s life.</li>
    <li>They travel on the road to last speeches.</li>
    <li>Forgive us our cynical thoughts.</li>
    <li>To taste my in altitudes fear your holding.</li>
    <li>No singing in the acid rain takes can quite.</li>
  </ul>
