My name is Lukas Zamora and I am a recent graduate from Texas A&M University with a B.S in Applied Mathematics and a concentration in Computer Science.

I am mainly interested in data analysis; whether it be exploratory data analysis, data visualization, or even data cleansing. I just love data!

When I’m not working on data analysis projects or applying to jobs, you can find me jamming out on my guitar, recording music with friends, reading, or browsing record stores.

This site serves as a portfolio showcasing various data analysis projects I’ve done. Feel free to visit my [github](https://github.com/lukaszamora) page for full Jupyter notebooks, datasets I’ve used, etc.
